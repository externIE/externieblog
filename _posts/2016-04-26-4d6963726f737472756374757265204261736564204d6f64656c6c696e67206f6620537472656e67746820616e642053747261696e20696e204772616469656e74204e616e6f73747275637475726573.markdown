In fcc and bcc  ls, the analysis of deformed  ed microstructures reveals that dislocation processes dominate from the macroscale to a limit of 5 nm, which may be reduced further. Deformed  ls may therefore emerge with a strength which approaches the theoretical limit and with hitherto unknown physical and chemical properties.  ed surface structures produced by plastic deformation are graded and have typically high strength and wear resistance.  d on an electron microscopical characterization of structural parameters the stress and strain in such surface structures can be calculated to formulate constitutive equations which can guide research and development of wear resistant surfaces such as in the components of wind turbine gearbox.
