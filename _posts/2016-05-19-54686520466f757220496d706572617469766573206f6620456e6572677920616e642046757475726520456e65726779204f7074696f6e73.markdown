This talk will introduce and discuss the concept of four imperatives of energy and articulate their implications in sustainable energy development. The four imperatives are, in the order of importance, Power Intensity, Energy Density, Cost, and Scale.
  Some newest figures of the four imperatives will be shared in order to illustrate that it is imperative to place a balanced approach to coal, oil, natural gas, nuclear, and renewable energy resources and their development. As an example for discussion, a priority list of strategies for technological developments in coal, natural gas and nuclear power as China’s top national energy policy, followed by a set of strategies for renewable energy developments in niche areas, is discussed.
