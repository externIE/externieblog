The current disruptive technologies in automotive and transportation systems such as diverse mobility, automated driving (including driverless cars), electrification, and connectivity are demanding the automotive research and education to expand their portfolio. One of the expanded portfolios is the vehicle intelligentification (VI), which is an enhancement to the traditional intelligent vehicle systems but focuses on the action part of making car more intelligent through either automation or intelligent utilization of information. The intelligence here is closely related to how human being is thinking, perceiving, making decision, and how they are influenced by the available information. Hence understanding the human driver and mimicking his actions in driving are the essential part of VI, on top of the other  ives. VI has many applications ranging from user experience/driver assistance to autonomous driving. For example, the key to the success of designing driverless car is no more than designing a “virtual driver” that can digitally mimic a human driver to drive a car. VI has a deep root in the traditional expertise of controls, sensing, and networking. In this talk, we use industrial examples to illustrate how the traditional automotive disciplines can contribute to VI and how some Vis are achieved through innovatively utilizing information and approaches. Our goal is to use this to motivate a rather broad thinking in the most exciting era of the automotive history.
