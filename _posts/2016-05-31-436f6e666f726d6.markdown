<p style="text-align: justify;">In this talk, I will share our recent experience in designing several end-fire antennas of extremely low profile. These end-fire antennas should be mounted on a conformal conducting surface and can operate over a wide frequency band (at least 100% fractional bandwidth). After some basic considerations about end-fire antennas, I shall review existing designs of wide-band and end-fire antennas. After that, three novel wide-band end-fire antennas will be introduced in details: narrow H-plane horn antenna, surface-wave antenna, and log-periodic monopole antenna. In the end, I shall also mention a few end-fire antennas that are worthy investigation in the future.
