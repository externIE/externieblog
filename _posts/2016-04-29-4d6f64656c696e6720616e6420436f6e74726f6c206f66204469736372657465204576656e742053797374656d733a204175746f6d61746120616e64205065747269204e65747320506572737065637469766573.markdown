  报告摘要：
  The extensive applications of information technology provide spurs to the blooming of highly automated and computer-integrated systems that increasingly play an essential role in the development of the human society, leading to the deployment of discrete event systems that are thought of as a mathematical or methodological abstract of many contemporary technological systems such as intelligent urban traffic systems, automated flexiblemanufacturingsystems,computernetworks,communicationprotocols, logistic systems, monitoring and control of large buildings, distributed data s, and concurrent software systems. The purpose of this talk is to briefly introduce ideas of the modeling and control of discrete event systems in automaton and Petri net perspectives. Supervisory control theory  d on formal languages and finite state machines is first reviewed and a Petri net approach is then recalled. Their comparison is demonstrated through a toy example from manufacturing.
