There is a growing awareness that nanotechnology will have a profound impact on energy generation, storage, and utilization by exploiting the significant differences of energy states and transport in nanostructures and macrostructures. Nanotechnology- d solutions are being developed for a wide range of energy solutions such as solar cells, hydrogen generation and storage, batteries, and fuel cells. Dr. Sun and his group are focusing on synthesis of various low-dimensional nanomaterials to address challenges in fuel cells, Li batteries and  l-Air batteries.
  In this talk, Prof. Sun will report their progresses how to apply various nanomaterials to solve problems in fuel cells, Li ion batteries, Li-S batteries and Na-Air batteries. In particular, how to rational design surface and interface of electrodes.
