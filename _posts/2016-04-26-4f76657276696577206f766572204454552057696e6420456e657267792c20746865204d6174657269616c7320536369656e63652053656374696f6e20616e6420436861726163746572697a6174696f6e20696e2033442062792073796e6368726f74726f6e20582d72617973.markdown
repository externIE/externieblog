This presentation will first provide an overview over the Section for Materials Science and Advanced Characterization, and the Department of Wind Energy at the Technical University of Denmark. The development of a so-called 3D X-ray Diffraction (3DXRD) technique is then described from idea to implementation. The use of this characterization technique has enabled detailed analyses of materials microstructures in 3D with micron or even sub-micron spatial resolution and to follow the microstructural evolution over time during for example mechanical loading or annealing. This has led to results challenging today’s understanding of key phenomena. Examples of key experiments are given. These experiments would not have been possible without the 3DXRD technique. Limitations of 3DXRD are discussed. On-going technique development and a complementary x-ray method are presented. Finally, challenges and suggestions for the future success of 3D/4D materials science are discussed.
