<p style="text-align: justify;">Body Structure in automobiles is a large, complex system that must perform several important functions for the total vehicle. The traditional Body Structure system consists of all welded body panels surrounding the passenger, powertrain and luggage compartments. Functional considerations for the Engineering of Body Structure includes considerations for all major vehicle attributes including safety, durability, aerodynamics, NVH (noise and vehicle harshness), vehicle mass and the packaging and attachment of all components.  Additionally, engineering of Body Structure must conform to the identified business assumptions for each vehicle program including program timing, manufacturing (tools, facilities and process) and cost (cost per vehicle and investment). This lecture will address all engineering considerations mentioned above.
