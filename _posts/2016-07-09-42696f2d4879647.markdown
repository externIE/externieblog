<p style="text-align: justify;">Extensive utilization of non-renewable fossil fuels has resulted in serious energy crisis and environmental problems. Hydrogen is considered as an ideal alternative to fossil fuels because of its high energy density and clean combustion product. Fermentative hydrogen production from biomass using anaerobic bacteria is receiving increased attention. Aquatic algal biomass, which may be sourced from mass cultivation or natural algal bloom, is considered as a promising substrate for hydrogen fermentation. This presentation will discuss about the innovation and development in hydrogen and biogas production from green microalgae Chlorella sp., and fermentation systems which has been established in Khon Kaen University.
