New system reliability models and analysis tools are being developed to aid in the successful development and commercialization of certain novel and evolving technologies. System reliability analyses, involving multiple failure processes, are important and challenging research topics, particularly when failure processes, such as degradation processes and random shocks, are competing and dependent. When component degradation models are extended to complex systems with multiple components, different perspectives of dependency should be considered in system reliability modelling. In this research, potential dependence patterns are investigated among multiple failure processes within and among components in systems and probabilistic models are developed to assess system reliability performance. For the reliability modeling of complex systems, if one component in the system degrades or fails prematurely, it is possible that other components will also degrade or fail prematurely given the shared working environment, which means component failure times are dependent. Existing system reliability models are extended to perform quantitative analyses for system reliability considering that the damages to the two failure processes caused by shocks are dependent. The research is organized into several scenarios, i.e., dependent failure processes are considered in different ways. Stochastically dependent component degradation processes are also studied, and extended gamma process models are used to model the dependent degradation process.  d on these new reliability models, different maintenance policies are derived to provide cost effective maintenance plans.
