Current  guidelines for healthcare emphasize rapid testing and reporting, which can be  better satisfied by point-of-care (POC) diagnostic tools rather than centralized  medical laboratories using automated multi-analyte  analyzers by trained professionals. With POC testing, the turn-around time is  significantly reduced, leading to earlier decision making and more efficient  medical treatment. At present, POC protocols are predominantly  d on  rapid-test immunoassay strips/cassettes that combine gold nanoparticles for  colorimetric (mostly qualitative) detection and flow-through systems for sample  delivery. Optical disc technology provides a promising alternative to today’s  POC testing protocol; we have established both the surface chemistry and signal  reading methodology for running bioassays of various molecular analytes on  bona  fide  optical discs (CD, DVD, and Blu-ray discs); these bioDiscs can be read  quantitatively with standard computer drives or stand-alone disc p s, i.e.,  without any modifications to the hardware and software  driver.
